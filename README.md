# Python Prediction Algorithm

- A simple algorithm in python for prediction of values from a .csv file

1) Prerequisite - Python 3.11, Sklearn, Pandas
2) This algorithm can be used in projects requiring extraction of data from .csv files to later be used as input data for a machine learning model
3) To change the prediction values, change the values in the 2D array on Line 10
