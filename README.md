# Prediction-algorithm-Python
A simple algorithm in python for prediction of values from a .csv file

To change the prediction values, change the values in the 2D array on line 10
The same algorithm can be used for other projects related to extracting data from a .csv file and predicting values

Python 3.11, sklearn and pandas are required
